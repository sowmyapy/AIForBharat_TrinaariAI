# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Farmer Early Warning System is an AI-powered platform that monitors crop health using satellite imagery and weather data to predict crop stress conditions early. When potential issues are detected, the system proactively contacts farmers via voice calls in their local language, providing clear and actionable advice to mitigate crop damage. The system leverages Agentic AI to provide intelligent, personalized support and includes an interactive Voice Chatbot Service that enables natural speech conversations with farmers in their mother tongue.
